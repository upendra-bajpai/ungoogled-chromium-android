	* It will probably also be helpful to check [Issue Tracker of Bromite](https://www.github.com/bromite/bromite/issues), which is another customized Android build
* If there is a problem, ensure it does *not* occur with regular Chromium or Google Chrome. If it does, then this is *not* a problem with ungoogled-chromium. Instead, please submit your feedback to the [Chromium bug tracker](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list) or Google.

When opening a new issue, please make sure:

* The issue is not covered in a previous one
* One problem per issue, do not mix multiple topics in one issu
* Please fill out bug reports with templates. Issues without templates will be closed. Screenshots and logs are also helpful.
