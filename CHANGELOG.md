# 94.0.4606.81-1
* Now using Android SDK 12 r02

# 94.0.4606.71-1
* Bookmark import-export is disabled (again)
* Now built with Android SDK rebuilt from s-beta-5 (Android 12 beta) and NDK r23. If you want to know how they are built, see [here](https://github.com/wchen342/android-rebuilds).
* For some reason the aforementioned public version of Android 12 SDK doesn't have new APIs in them, so they are removed (for now). Will re-investigate when formal version of SDK 12 release.

# 94.0.4606.61-1
* Re-enable proxy settings and bookmark import-export

# 94.0.4606.54-1

* Upstream security fixes
* Fix update notification flag
* Add always incognito mode

# 91.0.4472.114-2
* Add back 64-bit Trichrome

# 91.0.4472.114-1
* Upstream security fixes

# 91.0.4472.77-1
* Trichrome is temporarily rolled back to 32-bit. If it works fine 64-bit will be added back next version.
* Trichrome `apk` support can end any time due to Google decided to remove the ability of not using split modules, as well as stripe the ability of building `apk`s directly for some time now. After that, you will have to manually install an `aab` file using `bundletool` and a specific `aapt2` file. I will try to keep fixing it as long as I can but it can stop working any time from now on.
  * Adding to their recent move of limiting APIs, I reflect [the call from Fedora chromium package maintainer](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/chromium/blob/c4e9feabf040cc2f0c4bac40e8d06fbaf8923c33/f/chromium.spec#_178) that at this point, if you really value _free software as in freedom_, you would be better off use something else instead, like `Fennec F-Droid`.
